# VirtualResume
###Objective: To practice using basic HTML tags (including divisions, tables, lists) and formatting your HTML with CSS.

For this assignment you will need to create a well-formed and valid HTML5 page with an embedded CSS stylesheet.
Use CSS to format your webpage and keep your formatting rules in the head section of your html page. Include a list of references at the end of your page arranged in table format. Remember that resumes are supposed to look professional, so generally speaking, use a “less is more” approach to your design.
